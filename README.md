`first625.md` is a list of basic vocabulary.

This list is culled from the [General Service List](http://jbauman.com/gsl.html "General Service List") and [Wordfrequency.info](http://www.wordfrequency.info/) by [Gabriel Wyner](https://fluent-forever.com/the-method/vocabulary/base-vocabulary-list/).

I converted it into markdown, and stripped notes and marks.
